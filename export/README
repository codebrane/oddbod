Introduction
============
Welcome to the Oddbod! exporter side of the Oddbod Migration System (OMS). This set of scripts
will export various aspects of an Elgg 0.9.x database as modified openData Definition (ODD)
files. This set of scripts use the Oddbod ODD Profile, which is just a fancy way of saying they
add various attributes to ODD nodes that are not in the current ODD schema. They do this to
support the Oddbod Onion Approach to Data Migration (OOADM!). Oddbod will export the Elgg data
in the following sequence:

- users and their icons
- user profiles
- friend network
- communities
- community memberships
- user blogs and their postings
- community blogs and their postings
- user files
- community files

Each ODD file can then be imported into Elgg 1.5 using the Oddbod import plugin

Requirements
============
The Oddbod exporter needs to be run on the same server as the Elgg 0.9.x instance
as it needs access to the icons and profile photos.
To use the Oddbod exporter you need Ruby, at least version 1.9.1p0 as previous versions
have a REXML issue which prevents data being written to XML files in some circumstances.
Oddbod outputs human readable ODD files so you can check what's going on.
You also need the appropriate database module for Ruby. Oddbod has been tested with MySQL:
- download MySQL Ruby module from: http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=4550
- use the following to build it:
  sudo ruby extconf.rb --with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql
    you may or may not need to use sudo, depending how your mysql is installed.
  make
  make install
Also, oddbod requires the ruby mime-types library. To install this do:
gem install mime-types

Usage
=====
First configure Oddbod. Open the file config.rb and change the various bits 'n bobs to suit
your environment. Each aspect of Elgg 0.9 is exported as an ODD file except the files, which
are too big to fit in one ODD file. In this case, the files are split across multiple ODD
files in the specified directory. When importing the Elgg 0.9 files, just give the import
plugin the path to the directory.
Run Oddbod in the following sequence with the suggested output files or directory:

ruby oddbod.rb users oddfiles/09_users.xml
ruby oddbod.rb user-profiles oddfiles/09_profiles_users.xml
ruby oddbod.rb communities oddfiles/09_communities.xml
ruby oddbod.rb community-profiles oddfiles/09_profiles_communities.xml
ruby oddbod.rb user-blogs oddfiles/09_blogs_users.xml
ruby oddbod.rb community-blogs oddfiles/09_blogs_communities.xml
ruby oddbod.rb friends oddfiles/09_friends.xml
ruby oddbod.rb communities-members oddfiles/09_communities_memberships.xml
ruby oddbod.rb files oddfiles/files
